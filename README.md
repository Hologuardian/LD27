My game for Ludum Dare 27

Congratulations! You are the new head of a power company providing power to a local booming city. It is your job to power unbuilt tiles in order to keep up with the ever increasing demand.

Use the arrow keys to move the screen.

Clicking on a tile will select it in the bottom.

You can upgrade tiles for a cost, you money is in the top-left of the screen.

Generators will create power, while conduits will take power from the generators and power any valid neighbouring tiles.

Powering more tiles will increase your income.

You will lose if you do not power enough tiles to meet the demands of the city.
