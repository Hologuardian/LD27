Congratulations! You are the new head of Essentrika, a start-up power company providing power to a city in construction.
It is your job to provide a power grid that the construction crews will have to use when building the city.
You can see your current funds in the top left of the screen and the current power requirement in the top center.

Use the arrow keys to move the screen.
You can select a tile by clicking on it, from there you will be able to upgrade it into different modules.
Generators create power, conduits will carry power from generators to land tiles.
You can upgrade land tiles to use more power but provide more powered sections. (Conserve Space)
Funding will be provided at the rate of $20 per 10 seconds for each powered tile.

If you are for some reason you are unable to keep up with the demand the company will have to abandon the project.
